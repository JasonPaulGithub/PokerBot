    // Detecting flop patterns, i.e if looks like this: [x][x][y] i.e: K.K.7
    // Detect Straight draws, flush draws, and pairs on the board, if an opponent missed a draw.
    // Detect if an opponent is strong or weak depending on betting patterns,
    // opponent actions per stage can easily be set on the switchboard.
